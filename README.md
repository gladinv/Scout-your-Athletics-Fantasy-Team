# Scout-your-Athletics-Fantasy-Team

<p>Athletics goes back to the original Olympics. Since then, little has changed. Athletes compete as individuals, seeking to throw the farthest, jump the farthest (or highest) and run the fastest. But people like cheering for teams, waving banners and yelling like mad during matches, wearing their favorite player's jerseys and staying loyal to their side through thick and thin.  </p>

<p>What if athletics was a team sport? It could potentially be more interesting and would give us a new set of sports analytics to discuss. We might even reduce the incentives to do unsavory things in the pursuit of <em>altius</em>, <em>fortius</em> and <em>citius</em>.</p>
<p>This dataset contains results from American athletes in the horizontal jumps (triple jump and long jump) and throws (shot put, discus, javelin, hammer and weight). Let's read that in and examine women's javelin.</p>
